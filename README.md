## Project Overview
GiftTopUp is a web application designed to provide users with a one-stop shop for purchasing digital gift cards, game credits, and mobile top-up services at competitive prices. With an intuitive and responsive design, users can easily browse through various categories of gift cards and enjoy special deals and discounts.

## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://your-repository-url.git
   cd GiftTopUp
   ```

2. **Install required dependencies:**
   Since this project uses Tailwind CSS, ensure you have Node.js installed. Then, run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the local server:**
   After installation, you can view the project by using a local server environment such as `live-server` or `http-server`. Run:
   ```bash
   npx serve
   ```
   This will serve the project at `http://localhost:3000` (or another default port).

## Usage
After starting the server, open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`. You will see the main page where you can explore different gift cards and top-up services. Use the navigation menu to access various categories, and take advantage of the search feature to find specific items easily.

These are specified in a configuration file, `.create-next-app-config.json`, indicating the use of TypeScript, Tailwind, ESLint, and enabling support for directories and app structure.
